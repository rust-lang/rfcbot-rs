# CHANGELOG

`@rfcbot` is Rust's automated process manager for RFCs, tracking issues, etc.
As such, this application does not follow semver of any form.

However, we do maintain this changelog explaining high level changes to the way
rfcbot behaves so that the people who develop rfcbot or interact with it can
understand the bot better.

## Changes

+ rfcbot now accepts multiple invocations / commands per comment you post.
